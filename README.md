## Android application for online privacy and security

*Preserves privacy, prevents tracking, and provides access to restricted and hidden online content*

**InviZible Pro** combines the strengths of **Tor**, **DNSCrypt**, and **Purple I2P** to provide a comprehensive solution for online privacy, security, and anonymity.

### Tor
* Hides user's identity and location
* Defends against traffic analysis and censorship
* Protects online activities from surveillance
* Routes traffic through multiple servers
* Provides access to "onion" websites
* Open-source

### DNSCrypt
* Secures DNS traffic with encryption
* Verifies DNS server legitimacy using cryptographic keys
* Shields against DNS-based attacks like spoofing
* Guards against eavesdropping and DNS query logging
* Can block ads *
* Can protect against dangerous and malicious sites *
* Can block "adult" sites *
* Open-source

**Depending on the selected dnscrypt server*
**(Not available in Google Play version!)**

### Purple I2P
* Provides anonymous communication network
* Conceals users' identities and activities
* Defends against surveillance
* Ensures secure data transmission
* Distributed and self-organizing network
* Provides access to "i2p" websites (eepsites)
* Open-source

To start using **InviZible Pro**, all you need is an Android phone.
Just run all three modules and enjoy safe and comfortable internet surfing. However,
if you want to get full control over the application and your internet connection - no problem!
There is access to a large number of both simple and professional settings.
You can flexibly configure **InviZible Pro** itself, as well as its modules - **DNSCrypt**,
**Tor** and **Purple I2P**, to satisfy the most non-standard requirements.

**InviZible Pro** is an all-in-one application. After installation, you can remove all of your VPN applications and ad blockers.
 In most cases, **InviZible Pro** works better, is more stable, and faster than free VPNs.
 It does not contain any ads, bloatware and does not spy upon its users.
 
### Why InviZible Pro is better than other similar applications:
* Privacy Protection: Guards your online activities.
* Anonymous Browsing: Conceals your identity.
* Secure DNS Encryption: Protects your DNS queries.

To clone a project, use the command:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Gedsh/InviZible
```

To build **InviZible Pro** please use **Android Studio**.

If you see something like this:
_Illegal character in opaque part at index 2: C:\KStore\keystore.properties_

Please comment lines of the settings.gradle file in the project root, as shown below:

```bash
include ':tordnscrypt', ':filepicker'
project(':filepicker').projectDir = new File('android-filepicker/filepicker')
//Please comment line below if you are not the project owner
//project(':tordnscrypt').buildFileName = 'owner.gradle'
```

It is expected that you can solve build problems yourself, so there is no support for building.
