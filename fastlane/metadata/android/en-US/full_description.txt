So what are those three modules, and what do they achieve?


<b>DNSCrypt</b>

DNS is used by most applications to translate domain names into IP addresses to find a remote server with the site that you want to visit. But this communication is not encrypted and can be used by attackers. DNSCrypt encrypts and authenticates DNS traffic, thus preventing DNS tracking and spoofing.

* Encrypts DNS requests
* Protects against DNS spoofing
* Blocks ads¹
* Protects against dangerous and phishing sites¹
* Can block "adult" sites¹
* Hides visited sites from your provider
* Prevents some types of resource locks

¹ Depending on the selected dnscrypt server


<b>Tor</b>

Tor encrypts Internet traffic and hides your actual location. It uses thousands of computers around the world to mask your IP address and prevents activity tracking to preserve your privacy and anonymity. Tor also provides access to onion services. These are sites that are in a completely hidden network without censorship.

* Encrypts Internet traffic
* Prevents sites locking
* Can provide privacy and anonymity
* Provides access to "onion" sites


<b>Purple I2P</b>

The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is a hidden anonymous network. It includes thousands of computers distributed around the world. Purple I2P encrypts the traffic of your device and sends it through these computers to ensure privacy and anonymity. Start I2P to access I2P sites and other Invisible Internet hidden services.

* Encrypts Internet traffic
* Provides access to the hidden anonymous network Invisible Internet and "i2p" sites
